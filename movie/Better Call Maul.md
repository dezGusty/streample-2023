# Description

**Darth Maul**, also known simply as **Maul**, is a character in the *Star Wars* franchise. He first appeared in the 1999 film *Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace* (portrayed by Ray Park and voiced by Peter Serafinowicz) as a powerful Sith Lord and Darth Sidious' first apprentice. Though seemingly killed by Obi-Wan Kenobi at the end of the film, Darth Maul returned in the 2008 computer animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars (voiced by Sam Witwer).

## Storyline

With his training almost complete, Darth Maul must face six Jedi in order to reach his true potential, and become a Dark Lord of the Sith.

# Characteristics

## Concept and creation

After getting frustrated with a drawing by The *Phantom Menace* production designer Gavin Bocquet, concept artist Iain McCaig started covering it in tape. Both he and director George Lucas liked the result, described as "a kind of Rorschach pattern". The final drawing had McCaig's own face, with the skin removed, and some Rorschach experimentation (dropping ink onto paper, folding it in half then opening). Maul's facial tattoos were inspired by the indigenous peoples of Brazil. Maul is described as a thing of nightmares when his art design is finished.

## Portrayal

Darth Maul was portrayed by actor and martial artist Ray Park in *Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace* and *Solo: A Star Wars Story*.Peter Serafinowicz provided the character's voice in The Phantom Menace.
